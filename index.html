			<span class="comments"># Feb 09, 2023 </span><br/>
			I started to notice you and fall for you, yet I wasn't actually sure so I gave myself more time<br/>
			<span class="comments"># Jun 06, 2023. </span><br/>
			I noticed that I have completely fallen for you and my love for you growing day by day<br/>
			<span class="comments"># Nov 17, 2023. </span><br/>
			I finally prepared myself to knock you<br/>
			<span class="comments"># Feb 10, 2024</span><br/>
			I finally confessed to you in silliest way. But you told me we can remain friends :C I wanted to kick you that time<br/>
			I was not sure if I should confess to my love but, it was the best decision I have ever made</br>
			<span class="comments"># Mar 09, 2024. </span><br/>
			The dreamiest night our first date. It was my first ever date so I was awkward and nervous<br/>
			<span class="comments"># Since then, we spent happiest life every day.</span><br/>
			It was only after meeting you I got to know what life really is. It's only I met you, I got to know how it feels to be breathing</br> 
			It is like I have been dead this entire time. You are the one. It's you who taught me how to love</br> 
			It's you who brought me back to life<br/>
			<span class="comments"># We enjoy everything together.</span><br/>
			<span class="comments"># You are my whole universe. </span><br/>
			<span class="comments"># I wanna be with you forever.</span><br/>
			<span class="comments"># We will enjoy whole world together.</span><br/>
			Let me take an oath to never stop loving you<br/>
			To never leave you no matter what happens<br/>
			To make sure I will be holding your hand no matter how bad the whole world gets, <br/>
			I will never leave your side. Because babe, all the love I have, it's all for you<br/>


			<span class="comments"># You are the greatest love of my life.</span><br/>
			I realized that true love hurts sometimes, it does.</br>
			You are not always going to have only happy moments. </br>
			Happiness is not the only thing you can expect from love. But is the pain worth it all? </br>
            If I had to go through that pain a million times,</br> 
			I will happily choose it because it's more than just worth it</br>
			<span class="comments"># Waiting until I become your wife, we will be the happiest couple in the world.</span><br/>
			i.marry(u, in_the_future=<span class="keyword">True</span>)<br/>
			i.live_happily_forever_with(u)<br/>
